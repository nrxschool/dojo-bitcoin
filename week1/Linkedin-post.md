Dojo Nearx BTC.
Over the past week, Iâ€™ve been working on a Bitcoin Block Explorer built with the Ruby on Rails + Hotwire stack and a RegNet node (BTC testnet), deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. This project demonstrates the power of using Ruby on Rails for fast and interactive web apps, proving that Rails is more than capable of handling tasks traditionally associated with JavaScript frameworks.
ðŸŒŸ What I Learned:
How to communicate with a Bitcoin node via RPC.
Exploring Bitcoin methods for reading and creating wallets, mining blocks, and managing transactions.
Gained a deeper understanding of how Bitcoin works under the hood.
ðŸ’¡ While my UI/UX might not win any design awards (Iâ€™m not a frontend guy ðŸ˜…), Iâ€™m proud of what this project taught me about integrating blockchain technology into web applications. Itâ€™s another step forward in my journey to improve my skills and learn more about the many blockchains in the market.
This project was part of the BTC Dojo at Nearx where I had the privilege of collaborating with two amazing teams. Big shoutout to my teammates for the support and knowledge-sharing along the way!
ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaway: Rails + Hotwire isnâ€™t just about simplicityâ€”itâ€™s about building powerful, interactive apps while keeping the backend robust. This project showed me that Rails can do what JavaScript doesâ€”sometimes even better!
Looking forward to learning even more and diving deeper into blockchain development. If youâ€™re working on blockchain projects or have tips to share, letâ€™s connect! ðŸ’¬
